# name-my-tea
Find out what your cup of tea is called.

Name My Tea (formerly [namemytea.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20180712213923/https://namemytea.com/)) was one of my first web projects.

The site allows you to input the "milkiness" of your tea and how many sugars you take, and then gives you the name of this milk/sugar combination.

**Demo**: [https://peterwetherall.github.io/name-my-tea/](https://peterwetherall.github.io/name-my-tea/)

### Future ideas ðŸ’¡

- Introduce additional social media sharing links
- Each milk and sugar combination could give a completely unique name
- Detect and name sections on the milk scale to a higher resolution (e.g. eight splits instead of four)
